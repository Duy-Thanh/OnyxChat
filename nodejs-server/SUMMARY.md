# OnyxChat Server Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This project is a Node.js implementation of the OnyxChat server, providing a backend for secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging. We chose Node.js after determining that Rust was creating unnecessary complexity for development at this stage.

## Key Components

1. **Server Framework:**
   - Express.js for REST API
   - WebSocket support for real-time messaging

2. **Database Models:**
   - User: User account information
   - Message: Messages between users
   - RefreshToken: JWT refresh tokens
   - UserKey: End-to-end encryption keys
   - OneTimePreKey: Signal protocol one-time prekeys
   - Session: Encryption sessions between users
   - Contact: User contacts

3. **Authentication:**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Short-lived access tokens
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

4. **API Endpoints:**
   - Authentication: Registration, login, token refresh
   - Users: Profile management, contacts
   - Messages: Sending, receiving, status updates
   - Crypto: End-to-end encryption key management

5. **Mock Database Support:**
   - In-memory data storage for development
   - Mock implementations of all database models

## Running the Server

Two modes are available:

1. **Simple Server:**
   ```
   node src/simple-server.js
   ```
   A minimal implementation that doesn't require a database connection. Perfect for early development and testing.

2. **Full Server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The complete server with all features, requiring a PostgreSQL database or using the mock database in development mode.

## Next Steps

1. **Mobile Client Integration:**
   - Implement the Android client to connect to this server
   - Set up end-to-end encryption with the Signal protocol

2. **Testing:**
   - Add unit tests for API endpoints
   - Create integration tests for the full server

3. **Deployment:**
   - Set up Docker containerization
   - Configure continuous integration and deployment

4. **Features to Add:**
   - Group messaging
   - Media sharing
   - Push notifications
   - Message search and archiving
